/**
 * String interactions can be bound to numeric response variables,
 * instead of strings, if desired.
 * If detailed information about a numeric response is required then
 * the string interaction can be bound to a response variable with
 * record cardinality. The resulting value contains the following fields:
 * stringValue: the string, as typed by the candidate.
 * floatValue: the numeric value of the string typed by the candidate, as a float.
 * integerValue: the numeric value of the string typed by the candidate if no
 * fractional digits or exponent were specified, otherwise NULL. An integer.
 * leftDigits: the number of digits to the left of the point. An integer.
 * rightDigits: the number of digits to the right of the point. An integer.
 * ndp: the number of fractional digits specified by the candidate. If no exponent
 * was given this is the same as rightDigits. An integer.
 * nsf: the number of significant digits specified by the candidate. An integer.
 * exponent: the integer exponent given by the candidate or NULL if none was specified.
 * Attribute : base [0..1]: integer = 10
 * If the string interaction is bound to a numeric response variable then the base
 * attribute must be used to set the number base in which to interpret the value entered by the candidate.
 * Attribute : stringIdentifier [0..1]: identifier
 * If the string interaction is bound to a numeric response variable then the actual
 * string entered by the candidate can also be captured by binding the interaction to A
 * second response variable (of base-type string).
 * Attribute : expectedLength [0..1]: integer
 * The expectedLength attribute provides a hint to the candidate as to the expected
 * overall length of the desired response. A Delivery Engine should use the value of
 * this attribute to set the size of the response box, where applicable. This is not a validity constraint.
 * Attribute : patternMask [0..1]: string
 * If given, the pattern mask specifies a regular expression that the candidate's
 * response must match in order to be considered valid. The regular expression language
 * used is defined in Appendix F of [XML_SCHEMA2]. Care is needed to ensure that the
 * format of the required input is clear to the candidate, especially when validity
 * checking of responses is required for progression through a test. This could be done
 * by providing an illustrative sample response in the prompt, for example.
 * Attribute : placeholderText [0..1]: string
 * In visual environments, string interactions are typically represented by empty
 * boxes into which the candidate writes or types. However, in speech based environments
 * it is helpful to have some placeholder text that can be used to vocalize the
 * interaction. Delivery engines should use the value of this attribute (if provided)
 * instead of their default placeholder text when this is required. Implementors
 * should be aware of the issues concerning the use of default values described
 * in the section on Response Variables.
