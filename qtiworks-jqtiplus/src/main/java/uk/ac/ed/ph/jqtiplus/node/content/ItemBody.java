/**
 * The item body contains the text, graphics, media objects, and interactions that describe
 * the item's content and information about how it is structured. The body is presented by
 * combining it with stylesheet information, either explicitly or implicitly using the default
 * style rules of the delivery or authoring system.
 * The body must be presented to the candidate when the associated item session is in the
 * interacting state. In this state, the candidate must be able to interact with each of the
 * visible interactions and therefore set or update the values of the associated response
 * variables. The body may be presented to the candidate when the item session is in the
 * closed or review state. In these states, although the candidate's responses should be
 * visible, the interactions must be disabled so as to prevent the candidate from setting or
 * updating the values of the associated response variables. Finally, the body may be
 * presented to the candidate in the solution state, in which case the correct values of
 * the response variables must be visible and the associated interactions disabled.
 * The content model employed by this specification uses many concepts taken directly
 * from [XHTML]. In effect, this part of the specification defines A profile of XHTML. Only
 * some of the elements defined in XHTML are allowable in an assessmentItem and of those that
 * are, some have additional constraints placed on their attributes. Only those elements from
 * XHTML that are explicitly defined within this specification can be used. See XHTML Elements
 * for details. Finally, this specification defines some new elements which are used to
 * represent the interactions and to control the display of Integrated Feedback and content
 * restricted to one or more of the defined content views.
