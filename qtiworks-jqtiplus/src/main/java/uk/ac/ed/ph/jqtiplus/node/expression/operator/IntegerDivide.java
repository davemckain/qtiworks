 * The integer divide operator takes 2 sub-expressions which both have single cardinality and base-type integer.
 * The result is the single integer that corresponds to the first expression (x) divided by the second
 * expression (y) rounded down to the greatest integer (i) such that i<=(x/y).
 * If y is 0, or if either of the sub-expressions is NULL then the operator results in NULL.
