            Status:         Final Release

            Description:    This is the set of Schematron Rules to further enforce the QTIv2.1 Information Model. The rule sets that have been defined are:

                            [RULE SET GENERAL 1] Ensure that certain expressions are NOT used for Response Processing.
                            [RULE SET GENERAL 2] Ensure that the Item, Section, Test and TestPart identifiers are unique.
                            [RULE SET GENERAL 3] Ensure that AssessmentItem Response Declarations are correct.
                            [RULE SET INTERACTION 1] Enforce the correct use the TextEntryInteraction attributes.

                            RULE SET GENERAL 1: Ensure that certain expressions are NOT used for Response Processing. The set of rules are:-
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 1 :- The expression numberCorrect must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 2 :- The expression numberIncorrect must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 3 :- The expression numberPresented must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 4 :- The expression numberResponded must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 5 :- The expression numberSelected must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 6 :- The expression outcomeMinimum must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 7 :- The expression outcomeMaximum must NOT be used in Response Processing.
                            * RULE GENERAL 1a-Assertion 8 :- The expression testVariables must NOT be used in Response Processing.

                            RULE SET GENERAL 2: Ensure that the Item, Section, Test and TestPart identifiers are unique. The set of rules are:-
                            * RULE GENERAL 2a-Assertion 1 :- The AssessmentTest and a TestPart must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2a-Assertion 2 :- The AssessmentTest and an AssessmentSection must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2a-Assertion 3 :- The AssessmentTest and a direct child AssessmentSectionRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2a-Assertion 4 :- The AssessmentTest and a descendant AssessmentSectionRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2a-Assertion 5 :- The AssessmentTest and a descendant AssessmentItemRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2b-Assertion 1 :- Two TestParts must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2b-Assertion 2 :- The TestPart and an AssessmentSection must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2b-Assertion 3 :- The TestPart and a direct child AssessmentSectionRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2b-Assertion 4 :- The TestPart and a descendant AssessmentSectionRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2b-Assertion 5 :- The TestPart and a descendant AssessmentItemRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2c-Assertion 1 :- Two AssessmentSection children of a TestPart must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2c-Assertion 2 :- The AssessmentSection and a descendant AssessmentSection must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2c-Assertion 3 :- The AssessmentSection and a descendant AssessmentSectionRef must not have the same unique identifier.
                            * RULE GENERAL 2c-Assertion 4 :- The AssessmentSection and a descendant AssessmentItemRef must not have the same unique identifier.

                            RULE SET GENERAL 3: Ensure that AssessmentItem Response Declarations are correct. The set of rules are:-
                            * RULE GENERAL 3a-Assertion 1 :- ***To be completed***..

                            RULE SET INTERACTION 1: Enforce the correct use the TextEntryInteraction attributes. The set of rules are:-
                            * RULE INTERACTION 1a-Assertion 1 :- The StringIdentifier and ResponseIdentifier attribute values must not be the same.
