# QTIWorks Deployment Configuration
# =================================
#
# You need to make a copy of this file (called, for example,
# qtiworks-deployment.properties) and edit to suit how you're going to deploy
# the QTIWorks Engine. You'll need to tell your servlet container (e.g.
# Tomcat) where to find your version of this file when the QTIWorks Engine
# webapp is loading. Please see the documentation for details.
#
# Developer Note: Please don't put your own configuration in the supplied
# example/default configuration, and please don't commit your own configuration
# into the git repository!
#
# 1. Database configuration
# -------------------------
#
# Please see the installation documentation for details about database
# requirements. In all cases, you MUST specify the appropriate parameters for
# connecting to your QTIWorks Engine database.
#
# We have tested QTIWorks on PostgreSQL and MySQL, and provided examples of
# necessary parameters for them for convenience below. Uncomment and edit to
# suit.
#
# (a) PostgreSQL
#qtiworks.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
#qtiworks.jdbc.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
#qtiworks.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql:qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.username=qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.password=qtiworks
#
# (b) MySQL
#qtiworks.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
#qtiworks.jdbc.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
#qtiworks.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.username=qtiworks
#qtiworks.jdbc.password=qtiworks
#
# For other databases, please refer to your database's JDBC driver documentation for advice.
# You will also need to choose the appropriate "dialect" for communicating with the database,
# details can be found at:
#
# http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/4.1/devguide/en-US/html_single/#configuring-dialects

# 2. Data store configuration
# ---------------------------
#
# You need to specify where the QTIWorks Engine will store assessments, file uploads, XML
# and other data that doesn't fit well in the database.
#
# Please see the installation documentation for advice about this.
qtiworks.filesystem.base=/var/qtiworks

################################################################################

# 3. QTI Extensions
# -----------------

# Set to true to enable the MathAssess extensions
qtiworks.extensions.mathassess=false

################################################################################

# 4. Webapp configuration
# -----------------------

# Specify a name and email address for the QTIWorks Engine administrator. This name
# will be advertised as the main contact for the system.
qtiworks.admin.name=Name Here
qtiworks.admin.email=admin@example.com

# Please provide the base URL of this webapp *as seen from remote clients*.
# This should include the context path; but do not put a trailing '/' after this.
#
# (Remember that if your Tomcat is sitting behind a reverse proxy or gateway cache
# then you need to give the URL of the *front* end of the proxy.
qtiworks.base.url=https://webapps.ph.ed.ac.uk/qtiworks

# The web authentication method for "Instructor" users normally uses a simple login form.
#
# During development, you might want to bypass this and use a "fake" login that
# automatically assumes that a particular user is logged in. To enable this, uncomment
# and set the property below to the loginName of a System User who already exists
# in the database.
#qtiworks.web.authn.fake.login=loginName

# 5. Webapp features
# ------------------
#
# QTWorks includes a small number of optional features that can be turned on if
# required. To enable a specific feature, uncomment it and make sure it is set to 'true'.

# (a) The following feature provides public demo functionality, namely:
# - Public samples (when loaded into the system)
# - Public assessment validator
# - Public upload & run assessment
# - Information about QTIWorks
#
# Uncomment the following line to enable this feature
#qtiworks.features.publicdemos=true

# (b) The following feature provides a simple public REST upload & run API, as
# well as enabling an older WS API used by the Uniqurate authoring tool.
#
# NOTE: this feature is currently a sketch and requires further development.
# We recommend disabling this unless you really want to explore it.
# Scant documentation about using this can be found in the class JavaDoc in:
# qtiworks-engine/src/main/java/uk/ac/ed/ph/qtiworks/web/controller/anonymous/SimpleRestRunner.java
#
# Uncomment the following line to enable this feature
#qtiworks.features.rest=true
